# airlab

This is the source code for AirLab, a laboratory management tool specialized in antibody-based research. The code for the SQL database schema, web tools, and the iOS apps is contained here.
As of the date of acceptance of this project for publication in Genome Biology, AirLab is deployed in Google App Engine. Accesible at www.airlaboratory.ch
The API and AirLab databases are secure in that domain. The code is deposited here as is and requires deployment in the App Engine or any other server to function. The AirLab database at www.airlaboratory.ch is managed by the Bodenmiller laboratory and only user access is granted. However, this code can be used (following the provisions of the AGPL license) to deploy your own solution by you in your own server.
The iOS apps are already available in the App Store.
