		    <h4>In the clones section, you can manage all your antibody clones, and see clones from other groups you belong to. The information is structured in the following way Clone -> Lot -> Conjugate. Clones are the antibodies in your database, lots are the specific tubes for each antibody that you have purchased, purified, or obtained by any other means, conjugates are the aliquots of that clones that are labeled with metal isotopes or fluorophores. In this page, you can manage all this entities. The system will assign numbers to all lots and conjugates and you can use this numbers to keep your antibody stocks tidy and centralized for all the lab!! Lots are also considered reagents, as they can be purchased. Therefore, when a lot is added, it will appear as well in the "Inventory" section.</h3>

		    <h4>If you want to create a new Clone.</h4>
		    <ul class="list-group">
			    <li class="list-group-item">
					Add a clone by pressing <button type="button" style="float: none;" class="btn btn-success">Add Clone  <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span></button>
			    </li>
			    <li class="list-group-item">
					Fill the information. You can either select a protein from the already existing ones or type the name of a new protein. IMPORTANT, if you type a new protein name, this overrides the selection of one from the top list.
			    </li>
				<li class="list-group-item">
					Press <button type="button" style="float: none;" class="btn btn-success">Continue</button>

			    </li>
			    <li class="list-group-item">

			    </li>
			    <li class="list-group-item">
					A lot will be generated and associated with the clone. IMPORTANT! A reagent request will be also placed in the "Inventory" section.

		    <h4>Add conjugates:</h4>
		    <ul class="list-group">

					A conjugate will be generated and associated with the lot. A number will be suggested. Use this number to have your conjugates uniquely identified in your antibody stock. We recommend to use this system to have an efficient stock that all members of a lab can use.
